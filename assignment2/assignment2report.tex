{\bf Implementation details} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cross-validation was done by first generating a cell array of the binary targets for each emotion. Then, inside a for-loop, each fold is removed from the set of examples in turn, leaving a set used to train the decision tree, and the fold used to test the resulting trees for accuracy. A running total is kept of correct answers, along with a confusion matrix updated on each loop. These are used to define how well the decision trees performed.
  \item Best attributes were selected by ...
  \item Average results were computed by ...
\end{itemize}
Include at least: cross-validation, best attribute selection, computing average results\\
