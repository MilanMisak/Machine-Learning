{\bf Implementation details} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cross-validation was done by first generating a cell array of the binary targets for each emotion. Then, inside a for-loop, each fold is removed from the set of examples in turn, leaving a set used to train the decision tree, and the fold used to test the resulting trees for accuracy. A running total is kept of correct answers, along with a confusion matrix updated on each loop.
  \item Best attributes were selected in the suggested manner, by keeping track of p$_{\textrm{0}}$, n$_{\textrm{0}}$, p$_{\textrm{1}}$, and n$_{\textrm{1}}$ in the loop for each attribute, and using the provided formulae to compute whether or not the new attribute provides a greater information gain than the previous best.
  \item All data for the average cross-validation results is collected during the cross-validation, with a running total of correct answers, and the incrementation of entries in the confusion matrix. A call is made to a seperate function to get recall and precision rates, as well as F$_{\textrm{1}}$ measures, to keep the code tidier.
