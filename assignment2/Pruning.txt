pruning_examples shows a graph where tree pruning is used on a decision tree built using the default matlab libraries. We imagine tree pruning will first remove branches that result in the same value no matter the value of the attribute split on.

The pruning algorithm used is resubstitution pruning which substitutes leaf nodes with the most common attribute, until the error value is intolerably high.

The cost variable on the y-axis is the average number of comparisons for each classification. This is calculated by summing the probability that a leaf node is reached, by the cost it took to reach.

We think that this cost is calculated based on trees of different sizes, showing the value of cost for each size of tree. The blue line is probably without using pruning, and the red line is with using pruning.

The optimal tree size when using the pruning algorithm is where the cost is as small as possible whilst still having an error rate of the tree using cross validation.
